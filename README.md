# RAWMENT: Informatics 133 - Final Project

>A responsive web application that analyzes and displays instant ramen statistics to help college students find the best ramen for them. 

## Overview
As the stereotype says, many college students around the world live up to the concept of a “broke college student”. During our search for ideas, we thought we could use the data set of instant ramen noodles, a primary food source that many broke college students eat day to day. Our final project is a website to analyze and display instant ramen statistics to help college students find the best ramen for them. 

To build our project, we’ve opted to use a data set from Kaggle, which has compiled over 2500 independent reviews of different instant ramen brands and types from the website, “The Ramen Rater.” We will be analyzing and visualizing this data using JavaScript, TypeScript, Vega-Lite, and JQuery; for the front end, we will be using HTML and CSS. 

## Requirements

### Design
* Use Figma, an online collaboration design tool, to create mockups of each page
    - Figma Mockups with Style Guide: https://www.figma.com/file/XKVAFUWeG7JXBygHBhpzuT/RAWMENT?node-id=0%3A1
    - Figma Prototype with Style Guide: https://www.figma.com/proto/XKVAFUWeG7JXBygHBhpzuT/RAWMENT?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=min-zoom
* Use illustrations from websites like [Undraw.co](https://undraw.co/) and [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) to instill a sleek UI

### Pages
